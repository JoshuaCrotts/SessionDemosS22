# Session04 - pScheme Programming Language Part 1 (Lexing, Parsing, ASTs, Arithmetic S-Expressions)

In this session, we will start building a small Scheme-like programming language called pScheme (pronounced pico Scheme). We will review language grammars, reading input from the user, lexing, parsing, abstract syntax trees, and add code to handle arithmetic S-expressions. Next week, we will add environments/variables and procedures. In the final week, we will add lambda expressions, conditionals, and lists.

# Recompiling

To recompile, use `make`. The `mpc.c` and `mpc.h` files are included with the project so there are no libraries to link.
