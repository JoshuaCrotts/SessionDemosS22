# Session01 - Stack and Student Struct

This project contains the code to create a simple stack data structure backed by a linked list. To complicate things, instead of making the elements a primitive (e.g., `int`, `float`, etc.), we use a self-made `struct student` with two fields. 

## Recompiling

To compile the project, clone the repository to your computer. Then, navigate to this folder and type `make`. This will produce an executable `stack`. Run with `./stack` (this assumes a Linux setup).
