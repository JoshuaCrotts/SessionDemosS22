# Session05 - pScheme Programming Language Part 2 (Environments and User-Defined Procedures)

In this session, we continue building pScheme by adding environments, user-defined procedures, and variables. 

# Recompiling

To recompile, use `make`. The `mpc.c` and `mpc.h` files are included with the project so there are no libraries to link.
